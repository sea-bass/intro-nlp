# NLP Using Traditional Machine Learning
Contains examples that manually extract features from text and use them with "shallow" machine learning models (i.e., not using neural networks).

## Examples

[`manual_features.ipynb`](manual_features.ipynb) -- Shows how to define a manual set of features for classifying words with a Naive Bayes classification model.

[`bag_of_words.ipynb`](bag_of_words.ipynb) -- Shows to how extract bag-of-words features (and optionally perform frequency weighting) for classification with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

[`ngrams_generation.ipynb`](ngrams_generation.ipynb) -- Shows how to extract n-grams from a corpus of text for probabilistic text generation.
