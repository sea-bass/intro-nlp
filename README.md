### Rule-Based Processing
Here we will see basic string processing and syntax parsing using a grammar.

### "Traditional" Statistical Methods
Here we will see the "old school" of NLP, including bag-of-words representations and classifiers that do not use neural networks such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks
Here we will see the first forays into NLP with neural networks, using word embeddings to reduce vocabulary dimensionality and recurrent neural networks with elements like Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

### Transformers
Finally we will look at the most state-of-the-art deep learning based NLP models that do away with recurrent neural networks and take advantage of attention mechanisms.
